## Case
This was my first large 3d printed project, handwired keyboard, ergo keyboard.  I had some experience in 3d printing small things, soldering, firmware and python.

things I already had:
# 3d printer.  
ender 3 
I got it from microcenter for $100 a couple years ago and used it here and there.  Recently I was learning fusion 360 because tinkercad was not cutting it for anything serious.  
soldering irons
pinecil and cheap variety
lots of soldering accessories.
wick, flux, wire, solder, alcohol, etc. 
wire strippers
